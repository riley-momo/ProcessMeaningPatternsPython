# Process Meaning Pattern Ontologies

This folder contains the reference ontology for the process meaning pattern facts. In practice, this ontology is used and encoded as a reference taxonomy in the mapping. A sample mapping is provided in the mapping folder, encoded in YARRML, a more human-readable format for RML mappings that can be converted to RML.
